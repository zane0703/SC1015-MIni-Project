# SC1015 MINI PROJECT - NBA GAMES DATA

## Introduction
Through this mini project, we aim to analyse past NBA Games data to determine which variable is the best in predicting whether the home team wins, with the dataset taken from Kaggle, spanning all the games from 2003 to December 2022. Our aim is to provide valuable insights for NBA teams to better improve their games when they have the home team advantage.

## Problem Formulation
 - Which variable (FG PCT HOME, FT PCT HOME, AST HOME, REB HOME) is the best in predicting whether the home team will win?
 - Which classification model would be the best for our particular dataset?
 
 ## Flow of the Project
 
- ### Exploratory Data Analysis
  We first begin by doing some exploratory data anaylsis on the dataset to determine what we were working with. We included several plots of each variable columns that we were interested in for some initial insights to our problem statement.

- ### Classification Tree Fittings
  In our project, our team explored the use of
  1. Decision Tree Classifier
  2. Logistic Regression Classifier
  3. Random Forest Classifier
  4. Nearest Neighbour Classifier

  For each of the variables columns we were interested in, we fitted them into all of the classification tree models to determine which model is the best for our project case. From there, we made our analysis to determine which is the better variable to answer our problem statement.

## Conclusion / Final analysis

## What did we learn?
